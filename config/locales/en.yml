        <p>ÖNY is a french ready-to-wear label for men & women led by Audrey Jouanny. <br>

        Since 2015, ÖNY intents to give its own definition of fashion : <br>
        Think the garment as a vector of singularity.<br>
        </p>"

      the_creativity:
        "<p>We focus on creativity, quality and durability : <br>
        The different artistic collaborations feed the stylistic process. <br>

        <br>
        The basics of the sportswear wardrobe are each season reinterpreted to match with the urban lifestyle. <br><br>

        Colorful, graphic, sportswear, <br>
        The esthete is allowed to conjugate his own stylistic grammar. <br>
